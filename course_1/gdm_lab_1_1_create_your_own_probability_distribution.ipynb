In later parts of this course, you will learn how you can build models that automatically compute these probability distributions.

The goal is to assign probability values to a set of candidate words based on the context defined by the prompt. Then randomly choose from this list, a process known as **sampling**, to generate the next word. You will investigate how probabilities influence the generation of language and practice manipulating these probabilities to create sensible sentences. In doing so, you will mimick the basic principles of language models.\n",

This highlighted the **stochastic** (or random) nature of language models, where word choices are guided by probabilities rather than always following the same generation process.\n",

You did this by comparing the probabilities that you assigned for the candidate words for the prompts \"Jide was hungry...\" versus \"Jide was thirsty...\". This highlighted how context influences word choices. This is an important concept for building modern language models.\n",
